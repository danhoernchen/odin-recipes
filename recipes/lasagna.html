    <p class="intro">
      Lasagna is the ultimate comfort food, layering rich, savory ingredients
      into a dish that's both satisfying and hearty. Whether you’re preparing it
      for a family dinner or a special occasion, this classic Italian casserole
      never fails to impress. With its generous layers of tender pasta, savory
      meat sauce, creamy ricotta, and melted mozzarella, each bite is a perfect
      balance of flavors and textures. The beauty of lasagna lies in its ability
      to be customized—add vegetables, experiment with different cheeses, or
      make it with a meat-free sauce for a vegetarian twist. It's a timeless
      dish that brings warmth and joy to any meal, making it a true
      crowd-pleaser.

    <div class="steps">
      <ol>
        <li>
          Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over
          medium heat until well browned.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water.
          Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt,
          Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for
          about 1 <sup>1</sup>&#47;<sub>2</sub> hours, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
          noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse
          with cold water.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2
          tablespoons parsley, and <sup>1</sup>&#47;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon salt.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
          To assemble, spread 1<sup>1</sup>&#47;<sub>2</sub> cups of meat sauce
          in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise
          over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with
          <sup>1</sup>&#47;<sub>2</sub> of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with
          <sup>1</sup>&#47;<sub>3</sub> of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1
          <sup>1</sup>&#47;<sub>2</sub> cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and
          sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
          Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking
          spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake
          for an additional 25 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
